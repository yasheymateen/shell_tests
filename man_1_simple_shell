.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell
- The shell of what used to be two healthy Holberton Students...and a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
hsh [options][command argument]
.SH DESCRIPTION
A Unix Command line interpreter that displays a prompt and waits for the user to type a command, to which it again displays the prompt after executing the command.

If an executable can't be found, it prints an error message and displays the prompt again, thus it also handles errors.

The shell handles simple command lines made of only one word - excluding semicolons, pipes, redirections, or other advanced features.

The program is compiled this way:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh

It is then accessed by typing: ./hsh

It produces the same output as sh(/bin/sh)
